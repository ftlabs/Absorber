# FT Labs Absorber
It uses RSS feeds to find audio versions of FT articles.

## Description

### In short...
The absorber reads RSS feeds from 3rd party providers of audio versions of the FT. 

A check is run every two minutes.

For each item in the RSS feed, the absorber checks for a copy of the audio file (and an OGG version of it) in an S3 bucket, and for metadata associated with that file in a DynamoDB table.

If no file is found in the S3 bucket, a copy will be retrieved from the source the RSS feed points to, convert it to an OGG version and then upload both the source file and the OGG to the S3 bucket. 

Any metadata contained in the RSS for the file (as query parameters on the audio file URL) will be stored in the DynamoDB table.

### Existing items
If a copy of the audio file already exists in the S3 bucket, or an entry exists in the DynamoDB table, it won't be updated. If a newer file exists, the existing MP3 file and database entry must be deleted for the absorber to add them back again.
